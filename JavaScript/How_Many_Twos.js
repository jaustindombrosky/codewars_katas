//Write a function that returns the number of '2's in the factorization of a number.
//For example,

//twoCount(24)
//should return 3, since the factorization of 24 is 2^3 x 3

//twoCount(17280)
//should return 7, since the factorization of 17280 is 2^7 x 5 x 3^3
//The number passed to two_count (twoCount) will always be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
// 7kyu
